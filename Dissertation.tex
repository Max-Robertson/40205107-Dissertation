\section{Introduction} 
\subsection{Background}  
In recent years a shortage of IT skills has been seen, however a more severe shortage has been prevalent with Cyber security skills. With statistics like 45 percent of organizations claiming to be lacking in cyber security skills and (found by research done by the Information Systems Security Association) 70 percent of IT workers believe the lack of cyber security professionals is negatively impacting their existing work \cite{smith2018intelligent}. This has been a widely discussed issue in recent years and there has been a number of proposals for how to fix this 'cyber security skills gap' from developing the companies HR department so that an individual interested in gaining the relevant skills is given the appropriate training by the company to advancing security technology and crime deterrence so that less personnel are needed to close the gap \cite{cobb2016mind}. I however believe that an emphasis should be put on cyber security at an earlier age and high school students should be introduced to cyber security elements. If students are introduced to these elements at an there is more of a chance of capturing an interest in the subject and for  students to pursue a career in cyber security. Further more I believe if research is done in how to cater this material to the students and how to peak their interests the effect could be greater. This could be done through the use of gamification which has been proposed as a solution for engaging people in individually and socially sustainable behaviours, such as education \cite{su2015mobile}. CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions are held in cyber security communities which are essentially a gamfied environment where teams compete by completing different cyber security related challenges to ascertain 'flags' which will score them points. This project proposed to take the structure of a CTF competition and gamify it further for use in the education of cyber security.  
\subsection{Aims} 
As the area of 'the gamification of cyber security education' has been establishes as the area of research I shall establish some aims and objectives that I hope to achieve throughout the process of this project:  


My first aim is to gain an understanding of different learning techniques that can I could apply when implementing my project as well as have an in depth understanding of the concepts that I propose to utilize during the implementation. I will achieve this by doing extensive research and produce a literature review, breaking down different learning techniques. I will also further look into CTFs and the associated available technologies to give a better understanding of how they work and how I could utilize aspects of them in implementation as well as a look into gamification, how to make use of the positives and avoid any pitfalls.  

The second aim of this Honours project will be take the research done in the literature review and produce a tool that will help educate users in cyber security as well as engaging them in the subject as a whole all while making it easy to understand. To achieve this aim I will complete the following objectives. 
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
	\item Develop the application with reference to research.
	\item Develop learning materials to be used in conjunction with the application.
	\item Develop a web page to be used in conjunction with the application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{summary}
% summarise my literature review here 

 
% possibly talk about and explain randomness, random number generator ? how am i generating randomness ? 

\section{Design}
\subsection{Introduction}  
The literature has backed up the need for such an application, now I will look at how the areas covered can be implemented in the design of the application and go on to discuss how the applications infrastructure could be set up in an ideal scenario so that over 10,000 users can have access to the application at once.  

\subsection{Requirements analysis} 
After doing the appropriate research on the topic, and designing the concept for the application I then looked into how best to carry out the research to meet my aims and objectives. Williams defines qualitative research as allowing the user to explore and better understand the phenomenon whereas quantitative research provides and objective measure of reality \cite{williams2007research}. Greenbaum has further discussed these research methods \cite{greenbaum1999moderating} and cited Michiello's table as useful for deciding a primary research method (Figure \ref{Research}). 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figs/research.PNG} 
    \caption{Quantitative vs Qualitative} 
    \label{Research}
\end{figure}  

As the table shows the qualitative method would involve me studying the human interaction side of things, e.g making the application and through the form of questionnaires, getting data on how the application was useful. A quantitative method involves measuring things, numerical comparisons, discovering facts etc This would involve prototyping aspects of the application and measuring their use. Both methods would be valid for meeting the aims and objectives of the project if designed right. However the qualitative method in this case would involve testing the application on the target audience (high school students 
) and would therefore throw ethics into consideration. Another issue with the qualitative method is if I was planning to do a questionnaire to gather data on the effectiveness of the application, that questionnaire should really have  started to be designed earlier in the project life. The quantitative method however, could be useful in after theoretically designing the app prototyping components of it and gauging how useful it would be in achieving the desired effect by testing and measuring the technical performance of the prototyped components. This would help give insight into the proposed use of the technology and if it should be considered for this use. For this reason I have decided to choose the quantitative method of research and do a technical evaluation on prototyped elements of the proposed application.


\subsection{Application Design}  
To design the structure of the the application, and how the rooms/levels would be spaced out I used the literature to design an application that would effectively teach cyber security skills and knowledge. 

Firstly I would separate each “lesson” into a room in the game. A series of these rooms or “lessons” would make up a floor. These rooms would cover and teach different topics of cyber security. Instead of having floors cover different topics, which is how I had originally envisioned the application, the literature suggests that blooms taxonomy Is an effective teaching model to apply to cyber security education so each floor could represent a different level on the blooms taxonomy level of understanding. So as the user would progress up the floors the questions would get more complex and require deeper thought. This structure is illustrated in figure *.  This would allow the application to impart skills in an organised manor so that the user would get the most out of it and by the end of the application would be at the end of the blooms taxonomy understanding scale (change so makes more sense)

%insert figure here 

Another aspect to consider in regards to the structure is that putting “lessons” / rooms back to back requiring the user to complete the lesson in order to progress to the next would be a bad idea. This has been shown to stunt the learning of younger audiences and discourage them from continuing if they can’t get the answer. The literature backed this up implying that freedom of choice is an important factor in gamification and that it encourages the user to explore more and be more engaged with the learning process. To get around this the application feature something called “reward tokens” which the user would get every time they complete a room/lesson. Say there are 5 rooms on a floor, the user would need to obtain 3 reward tokens to proceed to the next floor. Therefore giving the user the freedom to choose which 3 lessons to complete. The user would also need to be stopped from just all 5 lessons on the first floor then only 1 in the second to progress, a solution to this would be to double the reward tokens the user gets for completing a lesson as the floors ascend and adjust the reward tokens needed to go up a floor according, this is illustrated in figure *. 

%insert figure here 

The user would also need to not be discouraged if they for example could only complete two the lessons and is stuck on completing a third on a floor. Having looked over extensive literature on feedback it suggests that just telling the user that they are wrong isn’t very effective but that giving the user some form of hint is beneficial for the user allowing them to not give up if they don’t know the answer but be pointed in the right direction. For this reason a hint system is included in the theoretical design of the application.  If the user unsuccessfully attempts a lesson 3 times then a hint room could unlock. 

The rooms could be designed to incorporate all of these features. In a typical room there would be an opening in every direction. One to the left taking the user to the previous room, one to the right taking the user to the next room, one above which will unlock when the user gets the question right and takes them to the reward room where they can collect the reward tokens and finally one below which would unlock on the third incorrect attempt taking the user to the hint room. This has been visualised in figure *insert figure here*  

The user would play as “anonybot” a robot working for moral Corp who when doing his job discovered they were unlawfully harvesting and processing the personal data of customers. When he confronted his superior about it he was locked down on the bottom floor of the headquarters. The user must play as anonybot as he ascends the floors so he can escape the HQ and out the company for what they are doing.

The inclusion of a character, story and an end goal to reach it all factors which have been cited as useful in engaging a younger audience with learning material, investing them and making them want to reach the end goal by the literature. As this application is aimed at the younger high school audience, with the aim of engaging them in cyber security this is also included in the theoretical design. 

So in summary the application would essentially be a gamified cyber security application, structured similarly to capture the flag (or CTF) events with the freedom of choice operating as the jeopardy style of CTF shown to be effective in engagement, the lessons serving as the challenges and the reward token serving as a flag. The hint system in place is also represented in typical jeopardy style CTFs. The difference is the character and story orientated take and the elevation of floors representing a respective level of Blooms Taxonomy. 
%discuss how the game would be structured levels, floors etc
\subsection{Lesson Design}  
As discussed the level design would be rooms bundled into floors, each floor representing a different level of complexity on Blooms Taxonomy. For this design chapter I will briefly discuss what some of the lessons in the rooms on the first floor would look like, what their content will be, their learning outcomes and then go on to discuss how I would achieve this. 
\subsubsection{Caesar cipher} 
%discuss the learning outcomes e.g teach what caesar cipher is, how to open up decoder, teach how to decode. Discuss that it would be MCQ. Mock up how it would look. How i will use api request and web scraping to do. 
One of the first things that would be covered in the application is basic encryption types, such as the Caesar cipher.  

\textbf{Learning Outcomes} 
\newline the learning outcomes for this particular lesson would be:  

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
	\item The user would know and understand what a Caesar cipher is 
	\item The user will be able to use an online decoder to get cipher text into plain text
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{Lesson Contents} 
\newline The user would first in a text terminal be told what a Caesar cipher is and would be explained how encryption and decryption work using it. The user would then be given a random Caesar cipher of a famous computer scientist and told to open a online decoder. Using the decoder and referring to the provided steps the user will be able to get the plain text and when entered in the terminal would unlock the door.

\textbf{How this would be done} 
\newline Dynamic challenge generation is an important part of this application and would ensure that the students all have a unique experience meaning users can't copy off of each other's answers and will have a different experience if playing again. This is discussed furthermore later in the design chapter. For this lesson I will make test scenarios using random selection and API requested methods, these will also be discussed further later in the design chapter. 

\textbf{How it would look} 
%insert figure here

 


 
\subsubsection{Hash crack}   
%discuss the learning outcomes e.g teach what md5 hash is that its a one way encryption so only way to crack is against dictionaries provide dictionarie then teach them to find which famous computer scientist it is.  Mock up how it would look. How i will use web scraping to do.  

Another lesson that would be covered on the first floor of the application is hashing. 

\textbf{Learning Outcomes} 
\newline the learning outcomes for this particular lesson would be:  

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
	\item The user would know and understand what a hash is 
	\item The user will be able to use the command line 
	\item The user will, with instructions, be able to crack a hash using a dictionary and john the ripper. 
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{Lesson Contents} 
\newline The user would first in a text terminal be told what a hash is, about one way encryption and the use of it. Then the user will be taught briefly about the command line, basic commands and about john the ripper. the user will then get given a famous computer scientist hashed and be guided with a set of instructions on how to run the hash against a dictionary of computer scientist to get a match using john the ripper. Once the user find a match they will enter it and the door will unlock.

\textbf{How this would be done} 
\newline For this lesson I will make test scenarios using the web scraping method, this will also be discussed further later in the design chapter. The lesson would then have a dictionary full of the hash value of different computer scientist provided to the user.  

\textbf{How it would look} 
%insert figure here
 

\subsubsection{Who is this ?}
%discuss the learning outcomes e.g teach young audience maybe who some famous computer scientists are and why they are famous. Discuss how i will make it get progressively harder until at the end they win reward token. mock up how will look. Discuss how i will use face api, bing api and webscraping to do this.  

Also a possible lesson on the first floor would be a simple "who is this famous computer scientist" stage.  

\textbf{Learning Outcomes} 
\newline the learning outcomes for this particular lesson would be:  

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
	\item The user will be able to recognise famous computer scientists.
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{Lesson Contents} 
\newline The user will be presented with a question "which one of these people is *insert person here*" , four pictures will then be displayed on the screen, one being the right person and one the three others being other computer scientist. When the user gets this right they will proceed to stage 2 and be asked again, this time it will be slightly harder, a less famous computer scientist. Finally if they get that correct they will proceed to the third stage with a lesser known computer scientist. By answering the third question correct the lesson would be complete and the door would unlock. An incorrect answer will result in the user having to go back to the first stage again. This technique of try and try again has been shown to be effective for imparting knowledge (find reference I found for this and insert). 

\textbf{How this would be done}  
\newline For this lesson I will make test scenarios using the web scraping method with the use of two API's, which I will go into more detail about later in this chapter.

%how this would look in the application etc mock up design 


\subsection{Technical Design} 
\subsubsection{Front end: User Interface}  
The user interface will take into account the literature and represent the application in the most effective way possible. Some drafted screens are shown below.  (Figure \ref{Mainscreen})

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figs/Ui_main_screen.PNG} 
    \caption{Main Screen UI mock up} 
    \label{Mainscreen}
\end{figure}   

The main screen has quite a lot going on. In a typical room, the player will have a choice to navigate both to the next room and the previous room to their left and right. If they go up they will reach the challenge terminal which when interacted with brings up the challenge. If they enter the correct answer the reward room will open up and they can collect their challenge token. If they get it incorrect the hint room below opens up. How many Challenge tokens they have is displayed and also the score they have accumulated so far. The user can quit or alter their settings with the drop down menu in the top left hand corner of the screen. (Figure \ref{Mainmenu}) (Figure \ref{fig:test1}) (Figure \ref{fig:test2})

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figs/Ui_main_menu.PNG} 
    \caption{Main Menu UI mock up} 
    \label{Mainmenu}
\end{figure}   

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Figs/Ui_reward_room.PNG}
  \captionof{figure}{Reward room}
  \label{fig:test2}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}   

When the user enters the hint room they are presented with a question and a choice of three answers. They will get the hint regardless but is meant to build their knowledge and whats been covered. The reward room is simple and just contains the challenge token. (Figure \ref{fig:test3}) (Figure \ref{fig:test4})

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Figs/Ui_correct_response.PNG}

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Figs/Ui_incorrect_response.PNG}
  \captionof{figure}{incorrect response screen}
  \label{fig:test4}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}  

The feedback received at this level is basic but dependent on what the answer is different doors unlock.

\subsubsection{Middle end: Dynamic Challenge generator}  
One fundamental part of this application will be the challenge generator. Dynamic challenge generation is an important element of this application, it will ensure that if the user comes back and does it again they will have a different experience and also that users will be having a different experience than the users around them. I will look at three possible methods of dynamic challenge generation. \emph{Random challenge selection, API request} and \emph{Web scraping}.  

\emph{Random Challenge selection} 

This will involve setting up a list of possible questions with corresponding answers, then selecting one of those questions at random. I will ask a multiple choice question populated with the correct answer and the answers to the other questions. The script would them check for the user input and check if the answer matches the correct answer giving simple feedback accordingly. This will be the simplest method and the easiest to implement (Figure \ref{RandomSelection}).  

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figs/random_selection (1).png}
    \caption{random selection flow chart} 
    \label{RandomSelection}
\end{figure}   


\emph{API request} 
I will set up an API using a python script so I can make a request to it with another script. The script will select a random word from a list, the world will correspond with a question that the API will send back when it receives this word. The user will then send back the answer which will be sent to the API and checked (Figure \ref{APIRequest}).   

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figs/API_request.png} 
    \caption{API request flow chart} 
    \label{APIRequest}
\end{figure}   


\emph{Web Scraping} 
I will develop two web scraping applications to test the effectiveness of it as a method of dynamic challenge generation, one simpler one and one more complex. for the more simple one I will scrape the names of influential computer scientists from sites like either 'https://www.computerscie
ncedegreehub.com/30-most-influential-computer-scientists-alive-today/' this or a Wikipedia entry on something similar. Then will read those names into a list. The challenge would be generated by grabbing a random name from that list and running it through an online hash generator, providing all the information you need for the challenge (Figure \ref{WebScraper}).   

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figs/Web_scraper.png} 
    \caption{Web scraper flow chart} 
    \label{WebScraper}
\end{figure}   


The more complex use of web scraping would involve using the Bing API and the Microsoft cognitive engine. The script would ask the Bing API for 100 cryptographers, it would then store images of them in a list, returns one at random and sends it to the Microsoft cognitive engine to see if it recognised it. This script would be used to ask the users if they recognise the famous cryptographers and check their answer against the answer returned from the Microsoft cognitive engine. (Figure \ref{FaceQuiz})   

%talk more about how it would work and then make diagram showing how it works%

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figs/Face_Quiz (1).png}
    \caption{Face Quiz flow chart} 
    \label{FaceQuiz}
\end{figure}    

\emph{Docker} 
%talk about use of docker and include figure showing how the api is going to be used to send data to database 
(Figure \ref{DockerFace})

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figs/Docker_face_pop.png} 
    \caption{Docker face pop flow chart} 
    \label{DockerFace}
\end{figure}    

\subsubsection{Back end: Databases} 
\textbf{SQL vs NoSQL}   
First off when designing the back end of an application what Database would be most efficient to use for the applications specific needs and potential uses. 
%reference and and back up use of NOSQL and mongo DB (also discuss that managing the database part of the application when it comes to scaling because a lot of the load comes from complex queries making requests take longer, so techniques such as cacheing complex query results and effective organising of db tables with keys and index can be effective in reducing load. %
\textbf{User Database}   
Discuss the user database (Figure \ref{UserDB})

\end{figure}   

\textbf{Challenges Database}

\subsection{Design Methodology} 
%discuss what i am going to do pick 100 computer scientists of 3 levels of fame etc etc   
With the application theoretically designed and elements of the application discussed I will now look at how I am going to test and evaluate these prototyped elements after they have been implemented to get useful data out of this project. To do this I am going to test 3 different aspects of my implemented elements. 
\subsubsection{How many times does the same question come up in the same run ?} This will be testing the effectiveness of the implemented dynamic challenge generation methods and how effective each method is for randomly generating a random question. This will also answer the question of what method is superior for this intended purpose, or has the most potential for this use.  

To do this I will for each script I have made for each of the dynamic challenge generation methods, make a separate version for testing that runs through the script 100 times collecting the questions and answer pair each time then after it has ran 100 times it will look at the list of questions and answers and find how many times the same pair occurred in the run. By doing this it gives a numerical value for comparison across all of the methods and helps gauge how effective that particular method is for this chosen purpose and therefore its potential. 
\subsubsection{How many out of 100 images are faces ?}  
This test will be testing the effectiveness of the Bing API that I have chosen to use in the implementation of one of the dynamic challenge methods and for use in populating a database with challenges. By testing this it will tell us how useful this technology is and if it can be utilised for this purpose effectively. 

To test this I am gong to make a test case of the script that uses the Bing API to collect faces for the challenge generation. In this proposed script a random topic such as 'famous computer scientists' or 'famous cryptographers' and then that is used as a search term for the Bing API which returns 100 images of that. I want to test how many of these 100 images are actually contain faces, or more accurately how many actually contain people. I will test this by using search terms with a varying likely hood to return faces, for example,  'Famous movie stars' is very likely to return a set of actors as they by nature are well known but a search term of 'famous cryptographers' on the other hand aren't as well known by nature. Doing this will not only evaluate how useful the Bing API if for general use but analysing different topics it can also be seen how useful it is for the specific  proposed purpose 
\subsubsection{Out of 100 computer scientists, how many does the face API recognise ?} 
This will test how effective the Microsoft cognitive engine Face API, used in my proposed web scraping face quiz script, is at recognising faces.  I believe this could be a very interesting test to carry out and the data gathered from doing this would not only be useful in learning how effective it would be to use this technology for the proposed purpose but for analysing exactly how good this technology is and help determine how it is working. 

To achieve this I am going to make a separate script all together for this test. I am going to gather a list of 100 computer scientists separated into three levels 'world famous' e.g Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, 'industry famous' and 'well known'. I will then gather multiple images of each person on the list and do 10 runs of each of the images.Outputted will be how many of the 3 images were recognised or a 'recognition score' and how many times out of the 10 runs that API recognised the person or a 'consistency score', this will be outputted in a graphical format such as a csv file. I will also feature in the tests some 'dud' images of for example people who look like Steve jobs but actually are not to test how accurate the service is being. As mentioned before it is my hope that these tests will determine how useful the Face API is and help pinpoint its behaviour.
\section{Implementation}
After the research had been done and I had designed in theory what my application would look like and how it would work I could start to look at the implementation. I decided for my implementation to prototype certain parts of my theoretical design. I chose to prototype the dynamic challenge generation part of the project as I felt that it was an important part of the learning experience to make sure that a different challenge could be given to a user each time they used the application, or if it was used in a class to ensure that all the users had different experience's using the application and couldn't copy other users answers out of laziness. Dynamic challenge generation was also an interesting area to look at I thought it would be interesting to evaluate the effectiveness of the different approaches in creating a different challenge each time. Another part I decided to prototype was the docker element of the project as docker is an incredibly useful service which would benefit the project greatly if made and prototyping an element such as database population would help illustrate that as well as gauge how efficient it would be.  

For the implementation stage I decided to use Python for the programming language and Eclipse as the IDE. I chose python out of a mix of personal preference as I has used in in the years leading up to this project and had more experience than any of the other programming languages and the practicality of using it for this project as python has extensive support libraries, useful for completing the variety of tasks that I wanted to do, combined with the fact that it is a widely used language and recognised in the industry it seemed like a sensible choice. Eclipse I chose to use as I have has exposure with it in my uni career and thought it better to use something I am experiences with and know than learn the specifics of a new IDE.

I will use the Eclipse IDE to develop python scripts for the different methods of dynamic challenge generation, at least a script for each. I will then use a combination of docker and python to create a service which populates a database with challenges in an efficient matter. The aim of this implementation stage is to develop something that in a later stage will give an understanding into which method of dynamic challenge generation is the most effective and how to best distribute this method.

\section{Results} 
%Results for for tests:out of X runs how many times did the same question show up ? to evaluate the three dynamic challenge generation method. test how many faces show up in search out of 100 ? to evaluate bing API effectiveness for different topics such as computer scientists and cryptographers. Out of 100 faces how many correct ? to evaluate facial recognition. Then evaluate further effectiveness of facial recognition by taking 100 famous computer scientists, cryptographers etc of varying fame level, very famous to kind of famous to not very famous and test success rate. feed it some duds, Bill Gates look a like etc.  
\subsection{Test 1: how many times does the same question come up in the same run ?} 
\subsection{Test 2: How many out of 100 images are faces ?} 
\subsection{Test 3: Out of 100 computer scientists, how many does the face API recognise ?}
